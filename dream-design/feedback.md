| | Feedback | Points | Notes |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| **Application Description (_4d_)** | The intent and scope of the application comes out clearly. |  |  |
| **Web Service(s) Used (_4d_)** | Utility scope is clearly stated. |  |  |
| **Top-Level Design/Layout (_1a_, _1b_, _2b_, _4d_)** | The section is not quite written as intended, as it serves as more of a functional specification than a design mockup. There is some reference to user interface elements but only at a general level. We’ll see if later sections fill in this information…<br><br>…OK, so after reading the rest of the document, there does not appear to be a top-level _design_ presented with relevant user interface elements for that level. Is the top-level view a menu? A dashboard? Something else? Some idea of that was what this section was looking for. | -5 | Most top-level information was provided except for an actual design/mockup of the top-level user interface itself |
| **Usage Scenario 1 (_1a_, _1b_, _2b_, _4d_)** | Nanny request scenario is completely specified, this time with design specifics and illustrations. |  |  |
| **Usage Scenario 2 (_1a_, _1b_, _2b_, _4d_)** | The job acceptance scenario has the same level of specification and illustration as the first one. |  |  |
| **Design Rationale (_1a_, _1b_, _2b_, _4d_)** | Design choices are well-grounded, using interaction design concepts, guidelines, principles, etc. appropriately. |  |  |
| **Usability Metric Forecast (_1a_, _1b_, _2b_, _4d_)** | Usability metric forecast makes sense given the design. Efficiency as the “sacrificed” metric is reasonable given the expected user base of the application. |  |  |
| **Writing** | References that are links should have a date of access, as currently practiced in formal writing today. Some entries are also formatted inconsistently (e.g., “Inc., Apple” vs. “_Google_, Google”; title preceding the author in the material design reference, etc.). | -2 | References can be formatted more consistently and with a date of access (for URL refs) |
| **Version Control (_4e_)** | 48 commits |  |  |
| **Punctuality (_4f_)** | on time |  |  |
|  |  | **93** | **Total** |
