## Interaction Design

### Learning Outcomes

This course explores the computer science subfield of  interaction  design  (IxD),  a.k.a. computer-human (or human-computer) interaction (CHI/HCI). IxD seeks to understand  human  behavior  when  interacting  with computing systems and studies metrics, techniques, and  theories  for  achieving  effective  interaction. Long  after  you  finish  this  course,  my  hope  is  that you will be able to:

1. Appreciate  and  express  the  art  and  science of  interaction design, including its theories, principles,  methodologies,  and  role  in  software design and development. 
2. Understand  and  report  on  how  humans  behave and interact with the user interfaces of real-world systems and software. 
3. Demonstrate  the  fundamentals  behind  designing and implementing user interfaces. 

In  addition  to  the  course-specific  content,  you  are also expected to: 

4. Follow  disciplinary  best  practices  throughout the course.
