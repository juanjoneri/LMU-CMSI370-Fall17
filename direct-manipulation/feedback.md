| | Feedback | Points | Notes |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| **Bubble look (_3a_, _4a_, _4b_, _4d_)** | Nice look with translucency, radial gradients, and drop shadow. Truly bubbly. | 10 |  |
| **Bubble motion (_3a_, _3b_, _4a_, _4b_, _4d_)** | Very convincing motion including increased buoyancy for bigger bubbles. | 30 |  |
| **Bubble creation (_3a_, _3b_, _4a_, _4b_, _4d_)** | Works as specified; the sound effect is a nice touch. | 20 |  |
| **Bubble inflation/deflation (_3a_, _3b_, _4a_, _4b_, _4d_)** | Works as specified, but with the chosen design, bubbles can only be moved briefly because they inflate while moving. You can have your cake and eat it too if you reverse the inflation behavior: inflate if the finger _isn’t_ moving, but move without inflating if the finger _is_ moving. | 25 | Lost ability to move bubbles completely independently of inflation |
| **Bubble popping/deletion (_3a_, _3b_, _4a_, _4b_, _4d_)** | Works as specified, although no feedback is given when a bubble is about to “pop.” A little signal that “one more click will end me” (red boundary? red color? throbbing animation? sound effect?) would give the user a full picture of the state of things. | 8 | No feedback when close to popping |
| **Code Style (_4c_)** | Jenkins green |  |  |
| **Version Control (_4e_)** | 36 commits |  |  |
| **Punctuality (_4f_)** | on time |  |  |
|  |  | **93** | **Total** |
